formula-ap1 is a REST API that provides data about the formula one racing series.

## Why does this exist?

The project started with the idea to build an open source F1 betting game.
While looking for services which could provide race data, I came across the free and handy
[Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/).
Unfortunately, it does not provide all data needed, such as top speeds data.
In addition to that, it looks like the API will be shut down at the end of 2024.
Therefore, I made the decision to collect the data myself via a web scraper and make it accessible via a REST API.

<!-- Unfortunately it did not provide all data needed as for example there are no top speeds data. -->

## Usage

You will find the OpenAPI documentation at [formula-ap1.com](http://formula-ap1.com/). <br>
**Notice:** If you want to try out the API via Swagger UI, make sure to not load the page over HTTPS, as
the API is served over HTTP, which leads to a
[mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) error.
Just use HTTP and everything will work.

## How is it built?

<!-- The API is built in Java with Spring Boot. PostgreSQL is used as database

The API is built in Java with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. More information about it can
Further documentation about it can be found in this README.
The data of the API is scraped by a web scraper that is built with TypeScript and NodeJs

The API is built in Java with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. Gradle is used as the build tool.
The data of the API is scraped by a web scraper that is built with TypeScript and NodeJs. It uses the
[Crawlee library](https://crawlee.dev/) for the scraping and the [got library](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got)
to pass the scraped data to the API. -->

The API is built in Java with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). A web scraper, built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/), is used to scrape the data with the [Crawlee library](https://crawlee.dev/) and send
it to the API by using the HTTP request library [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got).
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is used to set up
an Ubuntu server and deploy the API and the scraper via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
To secure the API, traffic is routed through the reverse proxy [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/):

## Docker

The API and the scraper image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are available on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/marcheiden/formula-ap1).

<!-- More information about each image is provided in the `Docker` section of the `README`
in the corresponding project directory. -->

## EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is used to define basic format styles.
The [`Editorconfig check`](./.github/workflows/editorconfig-check.yml) workflow checks whether all files comply with
the styles defined in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) when a pull request against `main` is created.
