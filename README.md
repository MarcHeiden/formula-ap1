formula-ap1 is a REST API that provides data about the formula one racing series.

## Why does this exist?

The project started with the idea to build an open source F1 betting game.
While looking for services which could provide race data, I came across the free and handy
[Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd/).
Unfortunately, it does not provide all data needed, such as top speeds data.
In addition to that, it looks like the API will be shut down at the end of 2024.
Therefore, I made the decision to collect the data myself via a web scraper and make it accessible via a REST API.

## Usage

You will find the OpenAPI documentation at [formula-ap1.com](http://formula-ap1.com/). <br>
**Notice:** If you want to try out the API via Swagger UI, make sure to not load the page over HTTPS, as
the API is served over HTTP, which leads to a
[mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) error.
Just use HTTP and everything will work.

## How is it built?

The API is built in Java with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). A web scraper, built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/), is used to scrape the data with the [Crawlee library](https://crawlee.dev/) and send
it to the API by using the HTTP request library [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got).
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is used to set up
an Ubuntu server and deploy the API and the scraper via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
To secure the API, traffic is routed through the reverse proxy [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/):

Further documentation of each project can be found in the `README` in the project directory.

## Docker

The API and the scraper image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are available on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcheiden/formula-ap1).

## EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is used to define basic format styles.
The [`Editorconfig check`](./.github/workflows/editorconfig-check.yml) workflow checks whether all files comply with
the styles defined in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) when a pull request against `main` is created.
